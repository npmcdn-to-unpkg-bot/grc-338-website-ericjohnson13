          <p>My name is Eric Johnson. I'm originally from Fullerton, Orange County, CA. I think the easiest way to describe me is to say that I collect as many talents as possible and become mediocre at all of them. It's interesting to see how these talents have developed over time.</p>
          <p>When I was in 5th grade, I started playing the saxophone. I wanted to be the next Paul Desmond or Charlie Parker (minus the heavy smoking or heroin addiction). I actually turned out to be a pretty good saxophone player and was playing in jazz bands by the age of 14. I probably would have continued on that path had it not been for another creative path that grabbed my attention.</p>
          <p>During 6th grade I had this intense desire to be the lead in the the 6th grade play. This was a big deal to me for some reason. It was strange, especially for a kid who had anxiety presenting in front of large groups of people. Why would I want to put myself in a position to not only present in front of hundreds of people, but sing and dance while doing it.</p>
          <p>It turns out that after mustering up enough courage to audition (and after the luck of getting cast as the lead), I found a new love in the theatre. I spent the rest of my school years performing in school musicals and designing lighting for productions as well.</p>
          <p>I attended my first year of university at Cal Poly State University San Luis Obispo as a Computer Science major. I then took 2 years off from school to serve as a missionary for my church in Costa Rica. While in Costa Rica I determined that I wanted to devote my studies to music. When I returned to the states, I transfered to Brigham Young University to study music.</p>
          <p>I spend two years at BYU working to be a music major, but after failing my audition, I fell back to my love of technology and finish my undergrade in Eletrical Engineering. Upon graduation I returned to the central coast of California, working for Cal Poly in the Graphic Communication department.</p>
